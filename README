>> Comparable corpus task <<

This repo contains the scripts, programs and data for creating the comparable corpus from the domain ontology, based on web documents.

If you want to download the corpus again, you will need to:
1) Have a registered Google ID in the Google University Research Program (research.google.com/university/search/)
2) Run the command :
  sh bin/get_all_corpora.sh <YOUR_GOOGLE_URP_ID>
  From the machine that has a fixed registered IP associated to your Google University Research ID
3) Use screen commands "CTRL + A" - "D" to close a screen and "screen -r LANG" to check the status of the download. Use "sh bin/corpus_stats.sh" and "tail conf_corpus/LANG/log.txt" to check work progress
3) The results are stored in the folder conf_corpus

Folders:

-> raw
